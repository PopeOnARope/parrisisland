    '<p>Entering 1966, the United States Military Command in Vietnam directed the Marines to begin actively engaging the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) in the remote mountainous jungles. Operation Double Eagle, which took place south of Chu Lai in January 1966, was the largest search-and-destroy mission to that date. The operation would strike at the growing Viet Cong and NVA presence in the region. Five thousand-plus Marines from various units searched the area and cleared out numerous North Vietnamese positions. South Vietnamese forces and U.S. Army Divisions also contributed to the operation.</p>\n' +
    '<p>The operation consisted of three components. Reconnaissance Marines would enter the area of operations ahead of the main force and provide intelligence on the Communist position. Two Marine battalions would land at Red Beach and begin operating along the coastline to give the appearance that they were only interested in strikes along the coast. The exploitation portion of the mission would involve limited B-52 strikes, followed by Marines deployed via helicopter.</p>\n' +
    '<p>The landing of Marines on 28 January was difficult, with heavy seas hindering the debarkation and establishment of artillery and logistical support. The wet weather was typical of monsoon season and weather delays plagued the forces throughout Double Eagle.</p>\n' +
    "<p>Despite these challenges, the exploitation phase of the operation continued as planned. B-52s struck targets, but weather delayed the landings from helicopters and ultimately Communist forces avoided contact with those units. The Army's 1st Cavalry Division did engage some of the NVA forces in the first days of the operation, however, both the Marines and the U.S. Army soldiers were unable to engage the majority of Communist forces who abandoned the region before any large-scale engagements occurred.</p>\n" +
    '<p>The operation concluded on 17 February, with 24 dead and 156 wounded Marines, and 312 enemy dead and 19 captured. Some elements of the operation would be reactivated the following month for Operation Double Eagle II, in response to reports of the 1st Viet Cong Regiment operating in the Que Son Valley.</p>',
