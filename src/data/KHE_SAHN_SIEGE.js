  TITLE: 'Siege of Khe Sanh',
  BACKGROUND: 'KHE_SAHN_SIEGE',
  DATES: 'January 1968',
  CONTENT:
    '<p>Located in a remote area west of Dong Ha, the Khe Sanh Combat Base functioned primarily as a support facility for surveillance units watching the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and the Ho Chi Minh Trail in neighboring Laos. Route 9, running east to west, provided the only ground route to and from Khe Sanh. A French colonial highway, Route 9 was a packed dirt track that was impassable during the monsoon season. Marines from 1st Battalion, 26th Regiment (1/26) had established a perimeter on hills surrounding Khe Sanh since sporadic fighting began in April and May 1967.</p>\n' +
    '<p>In October and November 1967, two North Vietnamese Army (NVA) divisions began to move through Laos and across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Suspecting an attack, the US Military increased the number of defenders at Khe Sanh to 5,000. At the same time, Operation Niagara I was launched in the first week of January 1968, using the various intelligence and strike capabilities of the Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force to monitor and counter NVA movements.</p>\n' +
    '<p>In mid-January, monsoons closed Route 9 while some 20,000 NVA soldiers occupied positions and established rocket launchers at Hill 881 North, Co Roc and Area 305. On 21 January, the siege began. While the Khe Sanh Combat Base never saw any direct ground attacks, the hills surrounding it faced NVA assaults, notably Hill 881 South and Hill 861 (named for their height in meters). On Hill 861, the Marines were initially driven off, but supported by mortar fire, fought their way back to the summit. As long as the Marines maintained their perimeter, the NVA could not carry out their final offensive against Khe Sanh.</p>\n' +
    '<p>Inside Khe Sanh, the Marines dug into the base’s red dirt to create underground bunkers. During the siege all supplies arrived by air; the entire time a helicopter or plane was on the airfield, it was under enemy fire. In response, the Marines developed a variety of techniques to reduce the time aircraft needed to be on the ground. Besides the use of air transport, tactical air support also played a crucial role in defending Khe Sanh.</p>\n' +
    '<p>On 1 April, the Marines, alongside the 1st Air Cavalry Division, a brigade of the 101st Airborne Division and South Vietnamese troops launched Operation Pegasus to end the siege. While the 1st Marine Regiment attacked west from Ca Lu in an attempt to open up Route 9, U.S. Army and South Vietnamese units landed on either side of the road and began clearing the area around the base while the Marines from Khe Sanh attacked the hills where the North Vietnamese were located. The operation concluded on 15 April, ending the siege and reopening Route 9. The siege of Khe Sanh cost its defenders 205 killed and 1688 wounded while the enemy suffered over 10,000 dead. The attacking two NVA divisions were virtually destroyed and unable to participate in the forthcoming North Vietnamese Tet offensive.</p>',
