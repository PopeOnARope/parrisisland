  DATES: 'December 7 1968 – March 8 1969',

    '<p>The city of Da Nang was one of the most important strategic locations in the I Corps section; a vital seaport, it housed a variety of support elements for operations throughout the northern provinces of South Vietnam. In 1968, the Marines launched a number of operations that targeted North Vietnamese Army (NVA) positions. Although several bases were destroyed, the enemy established Base Area 112 in central Quang Nam province that threatened the populous coastal regions around Da Nang and the combat base at An Hoa. To eliminate the threat the Marines created Task Force Yankee, which launched Operation Taylor Common on 7 December.</p>\n' +
    '<p>The operation consisted of three components. The first phase involved creating a well-supplied main station at An Hoa Combat Base and conducting search and destroy activities against elements of the North Vietnamese Army 2nd Division in a district termed “Arizona.” At the same time, air units began bombing areas where Fire Support Bases (FSBs) would be established to support strikes by four Marine Battalions and South Vietnamese units against Base Area 112.</p>\n' +
    '<p>In January 1969, Task Force Yankee began the final phase of Taylor Common which involved executing reconnaissance and surveillance operations as well as continuing to set up and run support bases to facilitate the neutralization of Base Area 112 and interdict avenues of approach used by the enemy from Laos into Quang Nam Providence. Despite the dreary monsoon weather, airplanes and helicopters played an important role in providing close air and logistical support. By mid-February, the command marked Base Area 112 neutralized, and the majority of the Marines were withdrawn while some briefly remained to man fire support and combat operation bases watching the approaches to Da Nang from Laos.</p>\n' +
    '<p>Over the course of the operation, the Marines suffered 183 killed and 1487 wounded. The South Vietnamese lost 100 killed and 378 wounded. Enemy losses were reported at 1398 killed and 29 prisoners. While the operation was successful in destroying North Vietnamese food, ammunition, and weapons, once the Marines left, the NVA returned to the area.</p>',
