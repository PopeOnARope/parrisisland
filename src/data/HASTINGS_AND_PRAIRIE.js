  BACKGROUND: 'HASTINGS_AND_PRAIRIE',
  DATES: 'July - August 1966',

    '<p>While domestic unrest surged across South Vietnam during the early months of 1966, the United States military command in South Vietnam became concerned about North Vietnamese Army (NVA) movements from the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) into Quang Tri Province. Initial Marine reconnaissance in May found no enemy, but in June Marine patrols discovered that the NVA 324B Division had entered the province’s northern sector. To counter the enemy’s movement the five-battalion Task Force Delta was created to take the lead in attacking the enemy division, with support from South Vietnamese forces.</p>\n' +
    '<p>The first major operation against regular NVA units, Operation Hastings, opened on 15 July, when two Marine battalions were helicoptered into the Ngan Valley and moved south against heavy enemy resistance, while a Special Landing Force battalion landed near the combat base at the Rockpile and marched north. Catching their opponents between them, the Marine detachments forced the NVA to withdraw. For the Marines, the battle was the largest and costliest of the war to date, involving eight thousand Marines and three thousand South Vietnamese troops. The operation ended on 3 August and cost the Marines 126 killed, 448 wounded, while 834 of the enemy were killed. </p>\n' +
    '<p>On the same day that Operation Hastings ended, Operation Prairie began. The purpose of the mission was to drive newly infiltrated NVA units from their entrenched positions located on a ridge known as Razorback, located north of the Rockpile. From August through October, Marines worked through their area of operations using close air support. Their actions ultimately forced the NVA to pull back across the Ben Hai River into the northern portion of the DMZ, but at great sacrifice; 200 Marines were killed and another 1000 wounded. There were an estimated 1000 NVA casualties during the operation. In the following months and into early 1967, additional operations Prairies II-IV would continue to sweep the area while at the same time guarding against further incursions across the DMZ. During these operations, the Marines began establishing a static defense line anchored on combat bases that eventually became known as the McNamara Line.</p>',

The Marines used it as an observation post, artillery position and a resupply point for helicopters. In late August, it was threatened by NVA machine gun fire from a hill mass known as Razorback, directly to the Northwest of the Rockpile.  A treacherous operation to neutralize the gunfire ensued.',

The NVA broke through the wire surrounding the artillery positions, however the attack was thwarted by the prepared Marines, who illuminated the area, and opened fire on the attackers. While the NVA did manage to destroy some equipment, the Marines saved the most important artillery pieces and prevented a larger scale attack on Cam Lo.',
