    '<p>Following Operation Starlite, on 17 November 1965, a reformed 1st Viet Cong Regimen seized Hiep Duc, a strategic outpost set between the mountains and the coastal plains. The unexpected action by the revived Viet Cong regiment caused the creation of Task Force Delta, consisting of the Marines of 2d Battalion, 7th Marines (2/7) and 3d Battalion, 3d Regiment (3/3) and units from the South Vietnamese Army. Together, they launched Operation Harvest Moon, which sought to prevent further incursions by the enemy, protect nearby Que Son and reestablish control of the area.</p>\n' +
    '<p>According to the operational plan, the South Vietnamese forces would enter the area from the northeast and draw the Viet Cong into battle. The supporting Marine battalions would land behind the Viet Cong via helicopters and attack from the south. However, that plan quickly went awry. On 8 December, the South Vietnamese began advancing towards Hiep Duc from Thang Binh. Shortly into their march, they were ambushed by Viet Cong forces and initially overrun until reinforcements stabilized the situation. Meanwhile, logistical issues plagued the Marines in trying to support the South Vietnamese. Task Force Deltaâ€™s commander, Brigadier General Melvin Henderson, moved the location of his command post three times in less than twelve hours between 9 and 10 December, during which Marine forces struggled to gain a foothold in the area. He was later relieved of command for failure to effectively command his troops and Lieutenant Colonel William F. Doehler replaced him.</p>\n' +
    '<p>Following the breakdown of the joint operation, Harvest Moon became a search-and-destroy mission. Beginning on 12 December, B-52 strikes dropped 500-pound bombs on the Phuoc Ha Valley for two days. After the strikes, Marines patrolled the valley looking for enemy survivors. The final engagement occurred on 18 December, when the Viet Cong ambushed the Marines around Ky Phu. The clash did turn in favor of the Marines, but it was costly.</p>\n' +
    '<p>Operation Harvest Moon was a qualified victory. On one hand, it cleared the area of Viet Cong. On the other, the strategy of surprise attack was completely interrupted by the ambush of the South Vietnamese. By the end of the operation, at least 407 Viet Cong were killed in action. The South Vietnamese Army lost 108 in action and the Marines 56.</p>',
