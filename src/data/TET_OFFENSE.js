    '<p>In 1967, the North Vietnamese planned a large offensive for late January 1968 during the Tet (Vietnamese Lunar New Year) celebrations.  Countrywide Communist attacks were scheduled to begin on 31 January, targeting many cities in the South. The North Vietnamese expected the South Vietnamese people to facilitate this general offensive by launching a widespread uprising in favor of the communist regime. Among the cities targeted by the North Vietnamese was Hue.</p>\n' +
    '<p>The Tet offensive at Hue City began on 31 January. The next day the NVA and Viet Cong launched their attack on Hue, the former imperial capital of Vietnam and the cultural and intellectual center of the country. Hue was divided by the Perfume River. On the north bank was the former royal enclave and its ancient citadel where the headquarters of the 1st South Vietnamese Division was located. A US military compound was located south of the river in the former French colonial settlement, termed the New City.</p>\n' +
    '<p>Two NVA regiments with Viet Cong support attacked the city. The 6th Regiment came into the old city from the west, with the objective of seizing the Citadel, while 4th Regiment entered the portion of the city south of the Perfume River. By dawn of 30 January most of the city, old and new, had fallen to the attackers and the Viet Cong flag was raised on the flagpole in front of the Imperial Palace of Peace. Despite these gains, soldiers and Marines still held the US compound south of the river and the South Vietnamese maintained their division headquarters in the Citadel.</p>\n' +
    '<p>US Military leaders initially underestimated the necessary forces needed to take back the city. While Allied forces attempted to cut supply lines, elements of the South Vietnamese Army and Marines from 2d Battalion, 5th Regiment (2/5) cleared the southern portion of Hue in house to house fighting in a week-long battle. The Marines then joined the South Vietnamese on the northern side of the river and fought to recapture the citadel and the palace.</p>\n' +
    '<p>Advancing from the north, the 1st Cavalry Division closed the last enemy supply route into Hue on 21 February. On 22 February, after ten days of fighting, the 1/5 Marines seized the southeastern wall of the citadel and drove the North Vietnamese from the city. The struggle for the Imperial Palace continued until 25 February, when South Vietnamese troops finally occupied the palace and replaced the Viet Cong flag with their own. The next day mass graves of civilian victims executed by the Viet Cong during the occupation were discovered. In total, 2810 bodies were found; however, it is believed there could have been as many as 5700 victims.</p>\n' +
    '<p>The Marine Corps suffered 147 dead and 857 wounded during the Battle for Hue City. South Vietnamese casualties amounted to 384 dead and more than 1830 wounded, while combined Communist forces found more than 5000 dead, with 89 captured and even more wounded. The Battle for Hue would be the longest and bloodiest of the Tet Offensive.</p>',
