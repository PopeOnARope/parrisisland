    '<p>During the summer of 1966, The United States Military Command in Vietnam began positioning Marine units in combat bases along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that divided North and South Vietnam. Among the posts garrisoned by Marines was Khe Sahn, an airbase in the western mountainous region of Vietnam. Intelligence indicated the presence of a sizable North Vietnamese Army (NVA) force, and the US command believed the Marines could win a decisive, conventional victory by defending the bases against enemy attacks. Marine Corps leadership was skeptical of this approach and worried that the redeployment of troops from the ongoing pacification and Combined Action Programs would harm these successful activities.</p>\n' +
    '<p>In September 1966, a battalion of Marines from the 3d Division was sent to Khe Sanh. During subsequent patrols, the Marines did not make any sustained contact with the North Vietnamese. The airstrip became incredibly important during the monsoon season as ground vehicles could not travel over the muddy, flooded roads, so helicopters were essential for resupply, casualty evacuation and reinforcement. Even when the monsoon season ended, helicopters remained the vehicle of choice during the Khe Sanh Hill Fights.</p>\n' +
    '<p>In March 1967, the NVA 325C Division moved into the region and occupied the high ground overlooking Khe Sahn. The NVA planned to overrun Khe Sanh in much the same fashion they had in 1954 against the French at Dien Bien Phu. They would use their positions on Hills 861, 881 North, and 881 South (named for their height in meters) to bombard and destroy the airfield, consequently isolating the base for easy capture. On 24 April, a Marine from Khe Sahn discovered the enemy near Hill 861. Immediately reinforcements of 3d Battalion, 3d Regiment Marines were airlifted into Khe Sahn and operations began to capture the three hills.</p>\n' +
    '<p>The NVA were heavily entrenched and camouflaged, making securing each hill bloody work. Massive artillery bombardments and air power were critical as the Marines persisted in capturing each hill. After the seizure of 881 North on 5 May, the NVA division began to withdraw. Throughout the Hill Fights at Khe Sanh, more than 150 Marines were killed and 400 were wounded. The military estimated that 1400 North Vietnamese soldiers had been killed. The Hill Fights at Khe Sanh represented only the first attempt by the North Vietnamese to dislodge the Marines from their Western outpost.</p>',
