    '<p>Operation Starlite was the first battle in which the Marines met the Viet Cong in regimental-sized forces. The battle gave the Marines the opportunity to witness the strength and skill of the organized guerillas. Early in August, intelligence indicated that the 1st Viet Cong Regiment was concentrated on the Van Trong Peninsula, alerting the U.S. Military Command in Vietnam to a potential attack on the Chu Lai Air Base, about ten miles north.</p>\n' +
    '<p>Major General Lewis Walt, commander of III Marine Amphibious Force, decided to use elements of the 3rd, 4th and 7th Marines to launch a preemptive strike against the Viet Cong. The plan consisted of three elements: one battalion would make an amphibious landing on the beaches south of Van Trong; another would deploy west of the area in three separate landing zones; finally, a single company would block off the northern escape. This plan, beginning on 17 August, would force the Viet Cong eastward and ultimately trap them against the sea. The fighting varied in its severity. Companies E and G of the 4th Marines landed at Zones White and Red via helicopter and faced little difficulty moving northeastward to link up with Company M, travelling overland from the north. However, Company H of the 4th Marines, who helicoptered into Landing Zone Blue, soon found themselves heavily engaged with the bulk of the Viet Cong regiment. On the coast, the Marines landed from amphibious tractors at Green Beach and became embroiled in a fight at the hamlet of An Cuong. The entrenched Viet Cong fought tenaciously, but the Marine’s firepower was too strong. Cornered, with their backs to the sea, few Viet Cong surrendered.</p>\n' +
    '<p>While the Marines ultimately achieved their objective of clearing the area, the Viet Cong proved themselves to be a worthy enemy. Close air support, tanks, Ontos and helicopter gunships were essential to the Marines’ operation. Starlite concluded on 24 August. The 1st Viet Cong Regiment was virtually eliminated, with a confirmed death count of 614. The Marines suffered 45 killed and 203 wounded. </p>',
