    '<p>While the US was committed to defending Khe Sanh and the A Shau Valley in the west, the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) chose to strike in the east against Dong Ha, an important Marine logistical command post. In late April, the NVA moved forces into Dai Do, a village northeast of Dong Ha consisting of five sub-hamlets, to prepare for the larger attack on the base.  On 29 April, South Vietnamese forces encountered elements of the NVA 320th Division at Dai Do</p>\n' +
    '<p>On 30 April, a Navy Utility Boat (LCU) was attacked on the Bo Dieu River south of Dai Do causing the Navy to shut down all further river traffic while LtCol William Weise received orders to investigate the attack with the Marines of 2nd Battalion, 4th Regiment (2/4). Weise directed a two-pronged assault. Hotel and Foxtrot Companies attacked from the north while Bravo Company, crossing the Bo Dieu River on amtracs, advanced from the south. Hotel Company seized the sub hamlet of Dong Huan. Foxtrot Company reached the outskirts of Dai Do, but was unable to seize the village and at nightfall joined Hotel Company at Dong Huan. Bravo Company landed and captured An Lac, but suffered heavy casualties and were unable to move farther inland.</p>\n' +
    '<p>The Marines renewed their offensive the following morning. The recently-arrived Golf Company, supported by two tanks, landed southeast of Dai Do and pushed inland, while Bravo Company renewed its attack from the south. The two companies pushed through heavily fortified enemy positions but were unable to link up. Golf Company reached the northern edge of the hamlet before being forced back and isolated just east of Dai Do. That evening Echo Company joined Bravo Company south of Dai Do.</p>\n' +
    '<p>On the morning of 2 May, fresh troops from Echo Company, broke into the village of Dai Do and with Golf Company secured the village. Hotel Company, supported by Echo Company, commenced an attack to the northwest to secure the last of the sub hamlets, but were stopped and driven back to Dai Do. That afternoon, Golf and Foxtrot companies launched a second, larger assault in conjunction with a South Vietnamese mechanized battalion. Initially successful, the Marines occupied Dinh To and Golf Company moved on to Thuong Do. However, heavy enemy fire coming from the east and the west, where South Vietnamese troops had failed to advance, coupled with a massive NVA frontal counterattack, drove the Marines back to a fighting perimeter at Dinh To, where they regrouped and prepared for another attempt in the morning.</p>\n' +
    '<p>The following day, Marines found that the NVA had abandoned their positions during the night. Unbeknownst to them at the time, the 2/4 Marines had taken Dai Do from an entire NVA division. The Marines suffered 81 dead and 397 wounded and prevented the enemy from attacking the Dong Ha logistical base while claiming 537 enemy casualties.</p>',

During the assault, the Marines begin receiving enemy fire from their left flank and rear due to the departure of the South Vietnamese. The enemy's firepower forced them to retreat back to Dai Do. They remained in the hamlet overnight and when they woke up the next morning, the enemy was gone. The battle was over.",
