    '<p>In January 1969, Marine Corps commanders received reports about enemy forces infiltrating from the Annamite Mountain Range along the Laotian border into South Vietnam’s A Shau and Sing Da Krong valleys. An increase in truck traffic and antiaircraft defenses led them to believe the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) was establishing a major logistical base, to be known as Base Area 611, in the A Shau Valley from which they could launch attacks against targets in the I Corps area.</p>\n' +
    '<p>Designed to block possible enemy incursions into the populous coastal lowlands and destroy Base Area 611, Operation Dewey Canyon, initially termed Operation Dawson River South, was developed. It was to be a three phased regimental sweep through the Da Krong Valley to Base Area 611, executed by Colonel Robert Barrow’s 9th Marines.  For deployment, resupply and evacuation, the Marines relied entirely on helicopters.</p>\n' +
    '<p>The operation commenced on 22 January. Using helicopters and supported by close air support by fixed-wing aircraft, the Marines moved south from Vandegrift Combat Base, establishing Fire Support Bases (FSBs) along the way. Once the FSBs were secured, Phase Two of the operation, now known as Dewey Canyon, commenced. Since it was the end of the monsoon season, the unpredictable weather was a constant problem. It delayed the advance of the 9th Regiment and often cost them the element of surprise. Even so, the Marines still managed to capture enormous amounts of equipment, ammunition, food, and a Russian-equipped field hospital while fighting off enemy attacks.</p>\n' +
    '<p>Once through the Da Krong Valley, Phase Three began with the Marines attacking Base Area 611, rotating companies to support the offensive. As they approached Laos, the Marines were granted permission by higher U.S. officials to cross the border to cut the North Vietnamese supply route. This was the first time during the war that United States troops entered Laos. The Marines continued their sweep through Base Area 611, along the border, and into Laos until 1 March, when they began a withdrawal that ended Dewey Canyon on 18 March.</p>\n' +
    '<p>Operation Dewey Canyon resulted in the destruction of hundreds of tons of weapons and munitions, and the capture of 16 artillery pieces, 73 anti-aircraft guns, 93 trucks and over 220,000 tons of rice. For seven weeks, the Marines operated 50 kilometers from their nearest base and continuously engaged the enemy.  They lost 130 killed, 920 wounded and one captured while the North Vietnamese suffered 1,617 killed. The operation also blocked NVA resupply and infiltration routes and pre-empted a major NVA spring offensive.</p>',
