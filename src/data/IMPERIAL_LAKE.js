  BACKGROUND: 'IMPERIAL_LAKE',
  DATES: 'August 1970',
  CONTENT:
    '<p>In late August 1970, intelligence reports indicated that the Viet Cong Front 4 Headquarters had taken up residence in the Que Son Mountains in Quang Nam province, southeast of Da Nang. Operation Imperial Lake sought to locate these headquarters and flush out the enemy from the surrounding region. On 31 August, one of the largest artillery bombardments of the war was launched by the 3d Battalion, 11th Regiment to force any enemy combatants into hiding. Four rifle companies were flown to Landing Zone (LZ) Vulture and surrounding locations to encircle the enemy positions and prevent any escape. Over four days, Marines scoured the area but did not locate any enemy soldiers.</p>\n' +
    '<p>Following the initial attack, the 7th Marine Regiment began search and destroy operations. On 16 September, a large underground complex featuring a kitchen and hospital complete with an operating room was located on the base of Hill 645, directly below the command post at LZ Vulture.</p>\n' +
    '<p>At the end of September and throughout the fall, unusually heavy monsoon rains and flooding struck the area. In October alone, four typhoons brought 17 inches of rain. The storms forced a reduction of activity for both sides, but the Marines of Operation Imperial Lake continued to patrol the Que Son Mountains. The 7th Marines turned over the operation to the 5th Marine Regiment in late September.</p>\n' +
    '<p>In early November, an enemy camp was taken, and a large quantity of documents recovered. They were the master files for the entire Viet Cong operation in Quang Nam province, including the names of underground leaders and agents. Later, on Christmas Eve, Marines discovered a large cave complex containing a variety of communications equipment, leading them to believe they had uncovered the Viet Cong command post.</p>\n' +
    '<p>At the beginning of 1971, the role of U.S. forces in South Vietnam diminished as part of President Nixonâ€™s policy of Vietnamization. Imperial Lake was one of the few major operations conducted by Marines into 1971. It involved elements of all three Marine infantry regiments remaining in Vietnam.</p>\n' +
    '<p>On 7 May 1971, Operation Imperial Lake ended. The Marines had lost 24 dead and 170 wounded. The operation claimed over 300 enemy soldiers and more than 200 captured weapons along with the knowledge that the operation had prevented Viet Cong forces from threatening valuable assets in the area.</p>',

Protected by the steep slopes of the mountain and a system of caves, they held out under Marine attacks for four days. Once the Marines realized the NVA could not be dislodged without assistance, they ordered an aerial attack on the position.',

        'To challenge Viet Cong activity, Marine planners devised a new plan of operations in the Que Son region. Starting on 18 October, continuous infantry patrols were supplemented by six to ten Quick Reaction Forces (QRFs). The QRFs were dispatched when a patrol made contact with enemy troops, with the intention of catching and eliminating hostile forces that had evaded capture up to that point.',
