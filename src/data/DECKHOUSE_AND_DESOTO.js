    '<p>Operation Desoto arose from the Joint Vietnamese-U.S. 1967 Combined Campaign to replace South Vietnamese troops with Marines and transfer the South Vietnamese to the Revolutionary Development Program, which worked to dismantle the Viet Cong infrastructure and connections with the local population. In their place, U.S. Marines would undertake offensive operations against Viet Cong formations.</p>\n' +
    '<p>One of these areas, the Duc Pho/Mo-Duc sections of Quang Ngai province, located in the southern end of the I Corps area, urgently needed the assistance of Marines. Intelligence revealed that North Vietnamese Army (NVA) troops had moved north into the area from II Corps region. Duc Pho had a strong Communist presence as its fertile coastal plains and salt flats provided much-needed supplies for the Viet Cong effort. The South Vietnamese controlled the area around the district capital, but throughout the remainder of the province, the Viet Cong constructed fortifications and maintained supply lines.</p>\n' +
    '<p>Operation Desoto commenced on 27 January. Marines from 3d Battalion, 7th Regiment (3/7) systematically worked through the villages, engaging the entrenched Viet Cong. Throughout early February, the Marines conducted search and destroy operations in the territory. They discovered large deposits of supplies, food and weapons. In certain hamlets, like Hai Mon, they also found extensive bunkers and cave systems that required extra ordnance to destroy.</p>\n' +
    '<p>Operation Desoto continued through March and April, frequently engaging the Viet Cong. By 7 April, 3/7 had positive military control over 43 sq km of Duc Pho and secured safe travel over another 50 sq km. However, the civil aspects were more complicated; 11,000 refugees from the campaign required housing and food. The operation was unique in that logistical support had to be provided by helicopter. Costs were relatively high; 76 Marines died over the course of the operation, while 573 were wounded, compared to 383 enemy casualties.',
