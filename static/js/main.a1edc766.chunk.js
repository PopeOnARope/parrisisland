While the US and South Vietnam initially recognized the DMZ and did not enter the region, the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) had long employed it as a staging area for infiltrating troops and supplies into South Vietnam. One of the ideas to counter these incursions was the use of the Strong Point Obstacle System (SPOS). SPOS consisted of a series of fortified bases where the garrisons, using sensors and surveillance devices, could detect enemy troop movement. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara was a chief proponent of this idea, which led to it being dubbed "McNamara\u2019s Line."</p>\n<p>The Marine Corps leadership was strongly opposed to the idea, which would take troops away from the mobile defense patrols currently used along the DMZ. However, US Army leadership made it a priority and also ordered Marines to assist in the construction efforts. As the area between Con Thien and Gio Linh was cleared, Marines were no longer able to continue major offensive operations and instead had to concentrate on securing the bases that made up the SPOS. Con Thien was a strategically important position to hold. If the NVA had the opportunity to capture it, their artillery could bombard the larger base at Dong Ha.</p>\n<p>The area bounded by Con Thien, Cam Lo, Gio Linh, and Dong Ha became known as "Leatherneck Square." Beginning in May 1967, throughout the construction of the SPOS, the NVA and Viet Cong, operating out of the DMZ, made numerous attempts to take the region.

Among the posts garrisoned by Marines was Khe Sahn, an airbase in the western mountainous region of Vietnam. Intelligence indicated the presence of a sizable North Vietnamese Army (NVA) force, and the US command believed the Marines could win a decisive, conventional victory by defending the bases against enemy attacks. Marine Corps leadership was skeptical of this approach and worried that the redeployment of troops from the ongoing pacification and Combined Action Programs would harm these successful activities.</p>\n<p>In September 1966, a battalion of Marines from the 3d Division was sent to Khe Sanh. During subsequent patrols, the Marines did not make any sustained contact with the North Vietnamese. The airstrip became incredibly important during the monsoon season as ground vehicles could not travel over the muddy, flooded roads, so helicopters were essential for resupply, casualty evacuation and reinforcement. Even when the monsoon season ended, helicopters remained the vehicle of choice during the Khe Sanh Hill Fights.</p>\n<p>In March 1967, the NVA 325C Division moved into the region and occupied the high ground overlooking Khe Sahn. The NVA planned to overrun Khe Sanh in much the same fashion they had in 1954 against the French at Dien Bien Phu. They would use their positions on Hills 861, 881 North, and 881 South (named for their height in meters) to bombard and destroy the airfield, consequently isolating the base for easy capture. On 24 April, a Marine from Khe Sahn discovered the enemy near Hill 861. Immediately reinforcements of 3d Battalion, 3d Regiment Marines were airlifted into Khe Sahn and operations began to capture the three hills.</p>\n<p>The NVA were heavily entrenched and camouflaged, making securing each hill bloody work. Massive artillery bombardments and air power were critical as the Marines persisted in capturing each hill. After the seizure of 881 North on 5 May, the NVA division began to withdraw. Throughout the Hill Fights at Khe Sanh, more than 150 Marines were killed and 400 were wounded. The military estimated that 1400 North Vietnamese soldiers had been killed.

Suspecting an attack, the US Military increased the number of defenders at Khe Sanh to 5,000. At the same time, Operation Niagara I was launched in the first week of January 1968, using the various intelligence and strike capabilities of the Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force to monitor and counter NVA movements.</p>\n<p>In mid-January, monsoons closed Route 9 while some 20,000 NVA soldiers occupied positions and established rocket launchers at Hill 881 North, Co Roc and Area 305. On 21 January, the siege began. While the Khe Sanh Combat Base never saw any direct ground attacks, the hills surrounding it faced NVA assaults, notably Hill 881 South and Hill 861 (named for their height in meters). On Hill 861, the Marines were initially driven off, but supported by mortar fire, fought their way back to the summit. As long as the Marines maintained their perimeter, the NVA could not carry out their final offensive against Khe Sanh.</p>\n<p>Inside Khe Sanh, the Marines dug into the base\u2019s red dirt to create underground bunkers. During the siege all supplies arrived by air; the entire time a helicopter or plane was on the airfield, it was under enemy fire.
