While the US and South Vietnam initially recognized the DMZ and did not enter the region, the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) had long employed it as a staging area for infiltrating troops and supplies into South Vietnam. One of the ideas to counter these incursions was the use of the Strong Point Obstacle System (SPOS). SPOS consisted of a series of fortified bases where the garrisons, using sensors and surveillance devices, could detect enemy troop movement. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara was a chief proponent of this idea, which led to it being dubbed "McNamara\u2019s Line."</p>\n<p>The Marine Corps leadership was strongly opposed to the idea, which would take troops away from the mobile defense patrols currently used along the DMZ. However, US Army leadership made it a priority and also ordered Marines to assist in the construction efforts. As the area between Con Thien and Gio Linh was cleared, Marines were no longer able to continue major offensive operations and instead had to concentrate on securing the bases that made up the SPOS. Con Thien was a strategically important position to hold.

They would use their positions on Hills 861, 881 North, and 881 South (named for their height in meters) to bombard and destroy the airfield, consequently isolating the base for easy capture.

Massive artillery bombardments and air power were critical as the Marines persisted in capturing each hill. After the seizure of 881 North on 5 May, the NVA division began to withdraw. Throughout the Hill Fights at Khe Sanh, more than 150 Marines were killed and 400 were wounded. The military estimated that 1400 North Vietnamese soldiers had been killed.

Suspecting an attack, the US Military increased the number of defenders at Khe Sanh to 5,000. At the same time, Operation Niagara I was launched in the first week of January 1968, using the various intelligence and strike capabilities of the Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force to monitor and counter NVA movements.</p>\n<p>In mid-January, monsoons closed Route 9 while some 20,000 NVA soldiers occupied positions and established rocket launchers at Hill 881 North, Co Roc and Area 305.

While the Khe Sanh Combat Base never saw any direct ground attacks, the hills surrounding it faced NVA assaults, notably Hill 881 South and Hill 861 (named for their height in meters).

The operation concluded on 15 April, ending the siege and reopening Route 9. The siege of Khe Sanh cost its defenders 205 killed and 1688 wounded while the enemy suffered over 10,000 dead.
